# OSPA Reference Documentation

Welcome to the reference documentation for OSPA (OpenStack Policy Automation). Here you will find service policy guides and technical references for all features currently implemented in OSPA.

## About These Guides

Each policy guide covers:
- **Service Overview**: Service identity and scope.
- **Supported Resources**: Resource types and operations supported in OSPA.
- **Policy Structure**: Example YAML structure for policy writing.
- **Check Conditions**: Supported checks for each resource/action.

Refer to the respective service guide above for current, up-to-date supported features. Features not yet listed are under development and will be documented once implemented in OSPA.
